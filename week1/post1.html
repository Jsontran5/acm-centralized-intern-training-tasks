            <p>During my time as a Software Engineer Intern at UCLA, I tackled real-world challenges by developing a directory app that keeps teams connected. Using Python, Flask, and the Slack API, I created a tool that updates team status in real time, making internal communication smoother and faster.</p>
            <p>One of my proudest achievements was implementing secure access through modern authentication protocols like OAuth2 and JWT, ensuring sensitive data was well-protected. It was an enriching experience that combined problem-solving with technical creativity.</p>
