            <p>Who doesn’t love free fries? My WingstopFreeFries project is an automated system designed to make the process of redeeming restaurant coupons hassle-free. Using Python and Selenium, I created a solution that has saved users thousands of dollars and countless hours.</p>
            <p>Beyond the automation, I built a responsive web interface with Flask and hosted it on AWS. By integrating Firebase for email parsing and scheduling tasks with cron jobs, the system works seamlessly with minimal intervention. It’s a project that combined technical expertise with a bit of ingenuity.</p>
